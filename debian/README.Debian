texworks for Debian
-------------------

An environment for authoring TeX (LaTeX, ConTeXt, etc) documents, with
a Unicode-based, TeX-aware editor, integrated PDF viewer, and a clean,
simple interface accessible to casual and non-technical users.

Note to use synctex feature you need to install TeX Live 2009 which
will be in Debian soon.

Temporary modifications:
1. I borrowed texworks.desktop, texworks.xpm and texworks.1 by
Stefan LÃ¶ffler <st.loeffler@gmail.com> in texworks-0.1.0~svn335~jaunty1
and I modified them a bit for Debian, especially, texworks.xpm 
was converted from texworks.png

2. I enabled to print PDF directly with a patch in
